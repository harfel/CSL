This is a simulator for the Chemical Swarm Language (v1.0)

The program requires python2.7, numpy, and matplotlib.
Example programs are distributed in the example directory.
To run any of them type

$ cd examples ; python ../simulator.py NAME

where NAME is the filename without the trailing .py suffix.

To stop simulation, one currently has to fire a kill signal (possibly several
times).

simulator.py -- mainly does initialization and graphics
api.py       -- contains all the logic
example      -- a folder with configuration files for several algorithms
