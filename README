the code is advanced enough for a
little preview. it requires python2.7, scipy and mathplotlib. installing
prerequisites shuld be straight forward using pip or easyinstall.

to start the example, run

$ python simulator.py example

to stop it, you will have to fire ctrl-c in the terminal two or more
times. here's a quick explanation of the files:

simulator.py -- mainly does initialization and graphics
api.py -- contains all the logic
example.py -- is the configuration file that sets up the system
(currently the flocking via sensitive docking example that I presented
in venice).

there are a couple of things missing in the simulator, mainly active
gradient ascent, material uptake/release, and sensible (neumann)
boundary conditions, and documentation :-(
